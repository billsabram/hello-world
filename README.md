# hello-world
A place of motivation and crafting to become a designer who can write some code!

Hi everyone!

My name is Bill Sabram, and I'm a designer that specializes in play, well-being, and learning. 
I want to learn some coding so I can build exciting prototypes, and collaborate on amazing projects with good people. 
I could have soup every. single. day. I also love sushi.
